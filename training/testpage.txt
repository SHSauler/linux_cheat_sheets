   King. Sure we thanke you.

My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed,






And iustly and religiously vnfold,

Why the Law Salike, that they haue in France,

Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme:

And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord,

That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,

Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule,

With opening Titles miscreate, whose right

Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth:

For God doth know, how many now in health,

Shall drop their blood, in approbation

Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to.

Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person,

How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre;

We charge you in the Name of God take heed:

For neuer two such Kingdomes did contend,

Without much fall of blood, whose guiltlesse drops

Are euery one, a Woe, a sore Complaint,

'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords,

That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie.

Vnder this Coniuration, speake my Lord:

For we will heare, note, and beleeue in heart,

That what you speake, is in your Conscience washt,

As pure as sinne with Baptisme
